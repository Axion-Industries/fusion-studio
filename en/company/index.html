Those fans who cry, laugh, and have their hearts touched by the stories we bring to life.... <br>
Thinking of each and every face on the other side of the screen, we wish to create animation that makes them say to themselves, “I am glad I encountered this animation”, that makes them want to watch it over and over again.<br>
As a studio, we strive to deliver animation that will remain in the hearts and minds of our fans, while challenging new forms of expression and experimenting with various genres without focusing on any particular style.  <br>

In the future, we plan to establish a CGI section for 3DCG, compositing, and backgrounds, while aiming at finalizing internally the in-between animation section and the digital paint section. <br>

The anime industry continues to grow along with the expansion of international markets. By building a more stable production base, our primary goal now is to increase the percentage of in-house production through increasing employment in order to meet rising demands. Our Sendai studio is actively involved in recruitment activities, collaborating academically with various vocational schools and universities in the Tohoku region. We intend to actively hire both new graduates and experienced employees, and to function as a receptacle for young people who aim at pursuing careers in the creative field, while also improving the education level and strengthening our organizational structure.</p>

Our Sendai studio is actively involved in recruitment activities, collaborating academically with various vocational schools and universities in the Tohoku region.

Located in the center of Osaka, it is easy for our artists to commute to the studio from neighboring prefectures, making it an attractive place to be at the forefront of the anime industry while residing in the Kansai area.
